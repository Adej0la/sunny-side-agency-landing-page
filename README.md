## My process

### Built with

- Accessible HTML
- SCSS
- CUBE CSS Methodology
- Fluid Typography
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how the flexbasis and order properties can make sizing and ordering layouts easy. I also learned how to apply CUBE CSS Methodology by Andy Bell and fluid typography using a type scale. The implementation of these could be better.

### Continued development

The concept of setting appropriate breakpoints more so the correct way is something I'll be looking to work on, this part was particularly tricky.

### Useful resources

- [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) - This helped me for very obvious reasons.
- [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs) - This is has proven to be very resourceful for when I need a refresher on correct syntax.
